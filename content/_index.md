Welcome to the website of the BioML group at the University of Copenhagen. In our group, we aim to solve biological problems using machine learning techniques. We are particularly interested in the relationship between protein sequence, structure and function. Our group is led by [Wouter Boomsma](https://ku-bioml.github.io/people/#wouter) and consists of people with a broad range of interests and expertise. </br> </br>
Please have a look around on our website! </br>
Meet our [group members](https://ku-bioml.github.io/people/), check out the latest [news](https://ku-bioml.github.io/news/) and [publications](https://ku-bioml.github.io/publications) and feel free to [contact us](https://ku-bioml.github.io/contact/).
